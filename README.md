## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of an Amazon India sales dataset. The project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow, starting from raw data cleaning and preprocessing, moving to database normalization, and culminating in the extraction of actionable business insights. The analysis was performed entirely within PostgreSQL, showcasing how to leverage SQL for powerful data manipulation and business intelligence. The dataset comprises over 128,000 sales records.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze transactional sales data to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategic business decisions. The goal is to move beyond raw data to provide clear, data-driven answers to critical questions about market performance, product strategy, and customer behavior.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from from Kaggle Dataset:

## Business Problems Explored
The analysis was structured to answer several key business questions:

Geographic Performance: Which states and cities are the most significant drivers of sales revenue?

Product Strategy: What are the best-selling product categories, and what are the most popular sizes within those categories?

Customer Segmentation: How does the purchasing behavior of B2B (business-to-business) customers compare to that of B2C (business-to-consumer) customers?

Operational Efficiency: What is the order cancellation rate, and what does it suggest about the sales pipeline?

Temporal Trends: Are there seasonal peaks or monthly patterns in sales performance that can inform inventory and marketing calendars?

## Key Findings & Insights
The SQL queries uncovered several critical insights:

Top Markets Identified: Maharashtra emerged as the top-performing state, with Mumbai and Pune being the most lucrative cities within it. This suggests that marketing and logistics efforts could be profitably concentrated in this region.

High-Value Products: While "Kurta" was the most frequently ordered item, the "Set" category generated the highest total revenue, indicating it has a higher average price point and is a key driver of profitability.

B2B Customer Value: The analysis revealed that B2B customers have a significantly higher average transaction value than B2C customers, identifying them as a crucial segment for targeted outreach and retention campaigns.

Seasonal Sales Peak: A distinct sales peak was observed in the month of April, pointing to a potential seasonal trend that can be anticipated for future inventory management and promotional activities.

Inventory Optimization: Within the top-selling "Set" category, sizes M, L, and XL were the most popular, providing clear direction on which sizes to prioritize in stock to meet consumer demand and minimize waste.

## Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations
This SQL-based analysis successfully transformed a raw dataset into a source of strategic business intelligence. The findings provide a clear path forward for optimizing the e-commerce business's operations.

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

Focus Marketing Spend: Concentrate digital marketing campaigns and resources on top-performing states, particularly Maharashtra.

Optimize Inventory: Prioritize stock for the high-revenue "Set" category and ensure sufficient inventory of the most popular sizes (M, L, XL) to prevent stockouts.

Develop B2B Relations: Create a dedicated strategy for B2B customers, potentially offering bulk discounts or loyalty programs to capitalize on their higher average order value.

Plan for Seasonality: Prepare for the annual sales peak in April by increasing stock levels and launching targeted marketing campaigns in the preceding weeks.

By implementing these data-driven strategies, the business can enhance its marketing ROI, improve inventory management, and foster growth in its most valuable customer segments.
